To start working on an existing project on the GitHub website
On the GitHub website
1) Find the project Repository and fork a copy.
2) Go to your account and find the forked copy, make note of the url at the top right and copy it.

On your terminal prompt
1) type "git clone paste-url-here"
2) type "cd name_Of_The_Project"
3) make changes within your fork
4) "git add ." to add all changes (change . to filename(s) to add specific files)
5) "git commit -m 'some message'" to commit changes
6) "git remote add upstream url-from-main-repository" (not the url from your forked copy, the url of the project you forked from)
7) "git pull upstream master" to get remote changes anyone else might've made
8) "git push origin master" to push changes to your remote fork (not the main one)
9)  After you push, on the GitHub website, go to your forked copy and on that page submit a pull request to the main project repository where it must be approved by the owner. When approved, the changes you submitted will be merged with the main copy.

To start from an existing project on your local machine
On the GitHub website
1) Create a new repository and give it a name
2) Within the newly created repository, copy the url (will refer to this url as URL_1)

On your terminal prompt
1) type "cd name_Of_The_Project"
2) "git init" to initialize git
3) "git add ." to add all files in your project
4) "git commit -m 'some message'" to commit changes
5) "git remote add upstream paste-URL_1-here" to create remote to the main project
6) "git push origin master" to initialize the remote repository with your code
7) "git branch development" to create a branch named development
8) "git checkout development" to switch to that branch named development (meaning commits will now be recorded on that branch)
9)  you can now submit changes to this branch with "git push origin development"
10) to merge your changes with the main branch, you can submit a pull request on the GitHub website but make sure you are doing it from the correct branch (in this example, the "development" branch).
